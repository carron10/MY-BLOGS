                            <p> Coding is the process of writing out steps for a computer to follow to achieve a goal or
                                perform a task.
                                Typically, coding is done using a programming language -- like Java or Python or C ,
                                which the coder
                                uses to translate his or her ideas into words, phrases, and syntax that the computer
                                understands. These
                                instructions are also called "commands." Coding is typically done as one critical step
                                in the larger
                                process of computer programming. Computer programming involves identifying a problem or
                                challenge,
                                considering potential solutions, writing code that can enact those solutions, and then
                                testing and
                                revising the code to achieve the desired results. </p>
                            <p> Computer programs, also called "apps," can generally be run on a wide range of machines
                                and devices,
                                including computers, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, and more. They include
                                everything from operating
                                systems, like iOS, Windows, or Android, to robust applications like Office or Photoshop,
                                to web-based
                                programs like Netflix or Instagram, to games like Minecraft or Candy Crush. Everything
                                that a computer
                                or device does is through a program. </p>
                            <h4> Why learning Programming </h4>
                            <p> Coding isn't just for "techies" or kids who want to work on computers. There are lots of
                                compelling
                                reasons for all students to learn to code. </p>
                            <p> First, it teaches students how to be digital creators -- to create their own websites,
                                apps, and
                                programs. Coding allows students to wield the full power of the internet -- and
                                multimedia -- to share
                                their ideas, talents, and creativity with the world. Coding also provides students with
                                skills that
                                apply across content areas. By learning to tell machines what to do, students engage in
                                problem-solving
                                and computational thinking, which apply to academic and professional disciplines across
                                the board For
                                example, consider heavily used platforms like Instagram or Amazon. These platforms use
                                algorithms, which
                                are coded formulas, designed to get users to use the platform as much as possible.
                                Knowing that these
                                platforms are coded this way helps students understand the larger ramifications of their
                                use: The
                                platform is able to collect more and more data, and there is potential for overuse and
                                for being
                                manipulated into using the platform more than is healthy. </p>
                            <p> Coding can also be lots of fun and provide students with a creative outlet, and it will
                                give them a leg
                                up when they begin pursuing a career and other professional goals. </p>
                            <p> "Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers,
                                but those skills
                                of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively â€¦ are things
                                that people can
                                use no matter what they're doing in their work lives." </p>
                            <h4>What you need to know before coding</h4>
                            <p> The short answer is, nothing. No formal prerequisites or specific skills need to be
                                mastered before kids
                                get started. Coding, does, however, challenge students to use their existing knowledge
                                and skills in
                                several areas, including: </p>
                            <p> Basic computer skills. Students will need to know or learn fundamental skills for using
                                a device,
                                including clicking, typing, logging in and out, etc. Logic. Coding challenges students
                                to: identify
                                cause and effect, sequence, make inferences, and perform other cognitive skills.
                                Perseverance. Coding
                                requires students to experiment and use trial and error to figure out which commands,
                                syntax, and
                                sequencing will lead to the outcome(s) they desire. This requires a certain level of
                                stick-to-itiveness
                                that can be challenging for learners of all ages. Attention to detail. Sometimes the
                                smallest of details
                                can cause coding syntax to error out or to not function as desired. Students will need
                                to apply or learn
                                mindfulness and patience when reading and writing their code. </p>
                            <h4>What resources are good for learning programming</h4>
                            <p><br> The trending technology is rapidly changing. In which teachers won't give full
                                potential to teach
                                you what real is taking place out there in these days. This is because most of them
                                learnt so many year
                                ago. Mayb even before python gets in this world therefore to keep yourself updated it's
                                good to use
                                different sources for learning programming and some technologies. Approaching coding in
                                this way -- as a
                                tool for navigating the digital world -- helps students make use of their existing
                                knowledge,
                                experiences, and values in the learning process. It supports them in making coding
                                projects that are
                                actionable and applicable to the real world There are lots of great apps out there for
                                teaching coding,
                                and the landscape is changing rapidly. </p>
