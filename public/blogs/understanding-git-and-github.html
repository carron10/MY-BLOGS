    <h3>Understanding git and Github</h3>
    <p>
        Through this post I will help you understand the two platforms git and github,their difference and what are they
        used for.
        In this post am not real focused on showing you git commands and more deep stuff, and therefore if you are
        interested on understanding git commands
        you should visit this post.

        <h4>Understanding version control</h4>
        <p>
            Version Control Systems(VCS) are the software tools for tracking/managing all the changes made to the source
            code during the project development.
            It stores your project(s) and allows you to view all the changes that you have made. What does this mean?,
            Think when you are developing
            your projects, their are many changes that you are making, where you are fixing bugs,deleting and updating
            codes. Sometimes
            you delete some codes and wish if you can get them back and that is where VCS comes in. A Version Control
            System allows
            you to view those codes that you have deleted by letting you see all changes that you have made from the
            starting point.
        </p>
        <h5>Types of Version Control System</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Local Version Control System</li>
            <li>Centralized Version Control System</li>
            <li>Distributed Version Control System</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Local Version Control System</h5>
        <p>Local Version Control is the one which is located on your computer. To use a Local Version Control you need
            to download and install it on your pc.
            The advantage of Local version control is that you don't always need internet in order for you to view the
            changes that you have made.
            The great disadvantage is that if your machine crashes all your project on Local Version Control will be
            erased
        </p>

        <h5>Centralized Version Control System</h5>
        <p>Centralized Version Control System is when the projects are put in one server that is accessible to your
            team. Think about it
            when your are developing one project with your friends, the good thing is to put the project in a place
            where your friends can
            edit it with their own machines.In the Centralized Version Control Systems, there will be a single central
            server that contains all the files related to the project</p>
        <img src="/img/centralised-version-control-system.png" style="width:100%; max-height: 400px;">
        <p>You can see that the only drawback of using centralized Version Cotrol is that, if it crashes everything will
            lost. Sorry if
            you have been wondering where the word <b> Repository</b> comes in,well this is just a place to store your
            project e.i I mean your project(s) in Version Control System</p>
        <h5>Distributed Version Control System</h5>
        <p>To overcome the problems of the above two, we have Distributed Version Control System which combines
            those above and make sure that there is also a VCS on your pc and the other(S) accessible to everyone.
            In a distributed version control system, there will be one or more servers and many collaborators similar to
            the centralized system.
            In this case if you have a project that you are doing with others, all the collaborators of that project
            will have their repository with
            the exact copy of project that you have.

        <h4>Difference between Git and GitHub</h4>
        <p>
            We have introduced each other to Version Conrol Systems, they is no doubt that these two are examples of
            Version Control Systems. Yes, Git and Github they are Version Control Systems but they work differently and
            they are originated from
            different Companies.

        </p>
        <p>
            Git is a Local Version Control System which tracks changes of the source codes on your PC. To use Git you
            need to<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> download and install it</a>
            to your machine.
            It can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.
            On the other hand Github is a Centralized Version Control System. It is used to host your source codes
            through web cloud services. The
            best thing about github is that even when your PC is at home you can go to your project repository and
            view/edit the codes.
            For you to use Github you need to create an account at <a class="btn-link"
                href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.
            Github works with Git whereby you <b>push/update</b> your source codes from your local repository to your
            github repository(remote repository).
            However using Git doesn't depend on github.
