        <p> In these series of articles I will show you how to built a website from scratch,resources that are needed
            and how to host your website on internet so that everyone can access it. Through your learning
            process you will come across to terms a <strong> Server</strong> and <strong>Client</strong> or Server and
            User.
        </p>
        <p> A server is a computer were your website is hosted(stored or served) and a client is a device that you are
            using
            to access a website, in this case your cellphone/computer. A user is a person who is accessing that website,
            in this
            case you are a user. So, to build a website first of all you need a computer to host a website, this can be
            your Laptop or your cellphone or other computers designed to be servers. You can use your computer as both
            for server and client, as long as there is
            chrome or any other browser installed on your device.</p>

            executed
            on the client side.
