                            <p> Coding is the process of writing out steps for a computer to follow to achieve a goal or perform a task. Typically, coding is done using a programming language -- like Java or Python or C , which the coder uses to translate his or her ideas into words, phrases, and syntax that the computer understands. These instructions are also called ""commands."" Coding is typically done as one critical step in the larger process of computer programming. Computer programming involves identifying a problem or challenge, considering potential solutions, writing code that can enact those solutions, and then testing and revising the code to achieve the desired results. </p> 
                            <p> Computer programs, also called ""apps,"" can generally be run on a wide range of machines and devices, including computers, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, and more. They include everything from operating systems, like iOS, Windows, or Android, to robust applications like Office or Photoshop, to web-based programs like Netflix or Instagram, to games like Minecraft or Candy Crush. Everything that a computer or device does is through a program. </p> 
                            <h4> Why learning Programming </h4> 
                            <p> Coding isn't just for ""techies"" or kids who want to work on computers. There are lots of compelling reasons for all students to learn to code. </p> 
                            <p> First, it teaches students how to be digital creators -- to create their own websites, apps, and programs. Coding allows students to wield the full power of the internet -- and multimedia -- to share their ideas, talents, and creativity with the world. Coding also provides students with skills that apply across content areas. By learning to tell machines what to do, students engage in problem-solving and computational thinking, which apply to academic and professional disciplines across the board For example, consider heavily used platforms like Instagram or Amazon. These platforms use algorithms, which are coded formulas, designed to get users to use the platform as much as possible. Knowing that these platforms are coded this way helps students understand the larger ramifications of their use: The platform is able to collect more and more data, and there is potential for overuse and for being manipulated into using the platform more than is healthy. </p> 
                            <p> Coding can also be lots of fun and provide students with a creative outlet, and it will give them a leg up when they begin pursuing a career and other professional goals. </p> 
                            <p> ""Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers, but those skills of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively â€¦ are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives."" </p> 
                            <h4>What you need to know before coding</h4> 
                            <p> The short answer is, nothing. No formal prerequisites or specific skills need to be mastered before kids get started. Coding, does, however, challenge students to use their existing knowledge and skills in several areas, including: </p> 
                            <p> Basic computer skills. Students will need to know or learn fundamental skills for using a device, including clicking, typing, logging in and out, etc. Logic. Coding challenges students to: identify cause and effect, sequence, make inferences, and perform other cognitive skills. Perseverance. Coding requires students to experiment and use trial and error to figure out which commands, syntax, and sequencing will lead to the outcome(s) they desire. This requires a certain level of stick-to-itiveness that can be challenging for learners of all ages. Attention to detail. Sometimes the smallest of details can cause coding syntax to error out or to not function as desired. Students will need to apply or learn mindfulness and patience when reading and writing their code. </p> 
                            <h4>What resources are good for learning programming</h4> 
                            <p><br> The trending technology is rapidly changing. In which teachers won't give full potential to teach you what real is taking place out there in these days. This is because most of them learnt so many year ago. Mayb even before python gets in this world therefore to keep yourself updated it's good to use different sources for learning programming and some technologies. Approaching coding in this way -- as a tool for navigating the digital world -- helps students make use of their existing knowledge, experiences, and values in the learning process. It supports them in making coding projects that are actionable and applicable to the real world There are lots of great apps out there for teaching coding, and the landscape is changing rapidly. </p>
