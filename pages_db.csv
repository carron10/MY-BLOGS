                    <h3 class=""text-center p-1"">Getting started with programming</h4> 
                        <div class=""p-2""> 
                            <p> Coding is the process of writing out steps for a computer to follow to achieve a goal or perform a task. Typically, coding is done using a programming language -- like Java or Python or C , which the coder uses to translate his or her ideas into words, phrases, and syntax that the computer understands. These instructions are also called ""commands."" Coding is typically done as one critical step in the larger process of computer programming. Computer programming involves identifying a problem or challenge, considering potential solutions, writing code that can enact those solutions, and then testing and revising the code to achieve the desired results. </p> 
                            <p> Computer programs, also called ""apps,"" can generally be run on a wide range of machines and devices, including computers, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, and more. They include everything from operating systems, like iOS, Windows, or Android, to robust applications like Office or Photoshop, to web-based programs like Netflix or Instagram, to games like Minecraft or Candy Crush. Everything that a computer or device does is through a program. </p> 
                            <h4> Why learning Programming </h4> 
                            <p> Coding isn't just for ""techies"" or kids who want to work on computers. There are lots of compelling reasons for all students to learn to code. </p> 
                            <p> First, it teaches students how to be digital creators -- to create their own websites, apps, and programs. Coding allows students to wield the full power of the internet -- and multimedia -- to share their ideas, talents, and creativity with the world. Coding also provides students with skills that apply across content areas. By learning to tell machines what to do, students engage in problem-solving and computational thinking, which apply to academic and professional disciplines across the board For example, consider heavily used platforms like Instagram or Amazon. These platforms use algorithms, which are coded formulas, designed to get users to use the platform as much as possible. Knowing that these platforms are coded this way helps students understand the larger ramifications of their use: The platform is able to collect more and more data, and there is potential for overuse and for being manipulated into using the platform more than is healthy. </p> 
                            <p> Coding can also be lots of fun and provide students with a creative outlet, and it will give them a leg up when they begin pursuing a career and other professional goals. </p> 
                            <p> ""Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers, but those skills of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively â€¦ are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives."" </p> 
                            <h4>What you need to know before coding</h4> 
                            <p> The short answer is, nothing. No formal prerequisites or specific skills need to be mastered before kids get started. Coding, does, however, challenge students to use their existing knowledge and skills in several areas, including: </p> 
                            <p> Basic computer skills. Students will need to know or learn fundamental skills for using a device, including clicking, typing, logging in and out, etc. Logic. Coding challenges students to: identify cause and effect, sequence, make inferences, and perform other cognitive skills. Perseverance. Coding requires students to experiment and use trial and error to figure out which commands, syntax, and sequencing will lead to the outcome(s) they desire. This requires a certain level of stick-to-itiveness that can be challenging for learners of all ages. Attention to detail. Sometimes the smallest of details can cause coding syntax to error out or to not function as desired. Students will need to apply or learn mindfulness and patience when reading and writing their code. </p> 
                            <h4>What resources are good for learning programming</h4> 
                            <p><br> The trending technology is rapidly changing. In which teachers won't give full potential to teach you what real is taking place out there in these days. This is because most of them learnt so many year ago. Mayb even before python gets in this world therefore to keep yourself updated it's good to use different sources for learning programming and some technologies. Approaching coding in this way -- as a tool for navigating the digital world -- helps students make use of their existing knowledge, experiences, and values in the learning process. It supports them in making coding projects that are actionable and applicable to the real world There are lots of great apps out there for teaching coding, and the landscape is changing rapidly. </p>

     <h4>Getting started with Java</h4> 
    </div> 
    <div class=""p-2"">
<p>
            JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language.  Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Java terminology
        </h4>
        Before we start learning Java, lets get familiar with common java terms.
        <h4>
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        </h4>
        This is generally referred as JVM. Before, we discuss about JVM lets see the phases of program execution. Phases are as follows: we write the program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Writing of the program is of course done by java programmer like you and me.
            </li>
            <li>
                Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.
            </li>
            <li>
                In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase.
            </li>
        </ol>


        So, now that we understood that the primary function of JVM is to execute the bytecode produced by compiler. Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems. That is why we call java as platform independent language. 
        <h4>Bytecode</h4>
        <p> As discussed above, javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved in a .class file by compiler.
        </p>
        <h4>Java Development Kit(JDK)</h4>
        <p>
            While explaining JVM and bytecode, I have used the term JDK. Letâ€™s discuss about it. As the name suggests this is complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.
        In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.
        </p>
        <h4>Java Runtime Environment(JRE)</h4>
        JRE is a part of JDK which means that JDK includes JRE. When you have JRE installed on your system, you can run a java program however you wonâ€™t be able to compile it. JRE includes JVM, browser plugins and applets support. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.

        These are the basic java terms that confuses beginners in java. For complete java glossary refer this link:
        <a href=""https://https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/information/glossary.html"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/information/glossary.html</a>

        <h4>Main Features of JAVA</h4>
        Java is a platform independent language
        Compiler(javac) converts source code (.java file) to the byte code(.class file). As mentioned above, JVM executes the bytecode produced by compiler. This byte code can run on any platform such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. Which means a program that is compiled on windows can run on Linux and vice-versa. Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems. That is why we call java as platform independent language.

        <h4>Java is an Object Oriented language</h4>
        <p>
            Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.
        </p>
        <b>4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Simple</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features like Operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.
        </p>
        <h4>Robust Language</h4>
        <p>
            Robust means reliable. Java programming language is developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible errors, thatâ€™s why java compiler is able to detect errors that are not easy to detect in other programming languages. The main features of java that makes it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation.
        </p>
        <h4>Secure</h4>
        <p>
            We donâ€™t have pointers and we cannot access out of bound arrays (you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you try to do so) in java. Thatâ€™s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow is impossible to exploit in Java.
        </p>
        <h4>Java is distributed</h4>
        <p>
            Using java programming language we can create distributed applications. RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications in java. In simple words: The java programs can be distributed on more than one systems that are connected to each other using internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine) can execute procedures on a remote JVM.
        </p>
        <h4>Multithreading</h4>
        <p>
            Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.
        </p>
        <h5>Portable</h5>
        <p>
            As discussed above, java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. 
            The platform independent byte code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java code portable.
        </p>

                            here variable name is <b>a</b>, which is associated with value 10,<code class="" language-c"">int</code> 
                            is a data type which represents that this variable holds integer values. We will cover the data types in the next topics. Here we will discuss about variables.

                        <h5>How to Declare(create) a variable in Java</h5>
                        <p>
                            To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value. Below is the syntax to create and assign value to a variable.
                            <br>
                            <b>data_type name= value</b>;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where <b>data_type</b> is one of the data types that would be discussed in the next article, <b>name</b> is the name of the variable , the equal sign(=) is an operator(we will discuss later about this) and value is anything for example number, word, letter etc.We call these data right.
                           <br> See this example.
<br>
                            <code class=""language-java"">
                                int num=10;
                            </code>

                            Here <b>num</b> is a variable ,<code class=""language-java"">int</code> is a data type and 10 is the value. We will discuss the data type in next article so do not worry too much about it, just understand that int data type allows this num variable to hold integer values. 
                            You can also declare a variable only without giving it a value such that you will assign a value later ..see below

                            <code class=""language-java"">int num;</code>
                            Then to assign a variable above you can just say
                            <code class=""language-java"">
                                num=10;
                            </code>
                        </p>

                        Variables naming convention in java
                        There are certain things that you need to know when naming a variable.
                        1) Variables naming cannot contain white spaces, for example: int first num = 100; This is invalid because the variable name has space in it.
                        2) Variable name can begin with special characters such as $ and _
                        3) As per the java coding standards the variable name should begin with a lower case letter, for example int number; For lengthy variables names that has more than one words do it like this: <code class=""language-java"">int smallNumber; int bigNumber;</code> (start the second word with capital letter).It is not a harm to start with uppercase but as practice we encourage you to follow the above.
                        4) Variable names are case sensitive in Java.For example the name Number is not same as number.
                        5)Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
                        <h5>Types of Variables</h5>
                        There are three types of variables in Java:

                        static variable
                        instance variable
                        local variable



                        Static (or class) Variable
                        Static variables are also known as class variable because they are associated with the class and common for all the instances of class.

                        <h6>Example of static variable</h6>
                        <pre>
<code class=""language-java"">
public class StaticVarExample {
   public static String myClassVar=""class or static variable"";
	
   public static void main(String args[]){
      StaticVarExample obj = new StaticVarExample();
      
      //Displaying static variables  ""class or static variable""
      System.out.println(obj.myClassVar);
      


      //changing the value of static variable
      obj2.myClassVar = ""Changed Text"";

      //displaying the static variable  ""Changed Text""
      System.out.println(obj.myClassVar);
   }
}
</code></pre>
                        <div id=""output"">Output:</div>

                        class or static variable
                        Changed Text

                        As you can see the value at the first is the one inside the class but outside the method and last output is the one inside the method only. This show us how to modify a static variable in java.

                        <h5>Instance variable</h5>
                        A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called instance variable. It is not declared as static.
                        It is called instance variable because its value is instance specific and is not shared among instances.
                        <h6>Example of Instance variable</h6>
                        <pre><code class=""language-java"">
public class InstanceVarExample {
   String myInstanceVar=""instance variable"";
	
   public static void main(String args[]){
	InstanceVarExample obj = new InstanceVarExample();
	InstanceVarExample obj2 = new InstanceVarExample();
	InstanceVarExample obj3 = new InstanceVarExample();
		
	System.out.println(obj.myInstanceVar);
	System.out.println(obj2.myInstanceVar);
	System.out.println(obj3.myInstanceVar);

		
	obj2.myInstanceVar = ""Changed Text"";

		
	System.out.println(obj.myInstanceVar);
	System.out.println(obj2.myInstanceVar);
	System.out.println(obj3.myInstanceVar);
   }
}
</code></pre>
                        <div id=""output"">Output:</div>

                        instance variable
                        instance variable
                        instance variable
                        instance variable
                        Changed Text
                        instance variable

                        <h5>Local Variable</h5>
                        A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.
                        A local variable cannot be defined with ""static"" keyword.

                        <h6>Example of Local variable</h6>
                        <pre><code class=""language-java"">
public class VariableExample {
   // instance variable
   public String var1=""instance variable"";
    
   public void myMethod(){
    	// local variable
    	String var= ""Inside Method"";
    	System.out.println(var);
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
      // Creating object
      VariableExample obj = new VariableExample();
    	
      /* We are calling the method, that changes the 
       * value of myVar. We are displaying var1 again after 
       * the method call, to demonstrate that the local 
       * variable scope is limited to the method itself.
       */
      System.out.println(""Calling Method"");
      obj.myMethod();
      System.out.println(obj.var);
   }
}
</code></pre>
                        <div id=""output"">Output:</div>

                        Calling Method
                        Inside Method
                        instance variable

                        If you try to access a local variable in another method, the compiler with throw an error. This is because a local variable is only accessed and used by the method that it is created inside it. 
                        <h6>For example</h6>
                        <pre><code class=""language-java"">
public class localVar{
     public static void main(String args[]){
         localVar obj=localVar();
         String var=obj.name;
        System.out.print(var);
   }
  public void printName(){
     String name=""Chatsfly"";
 }

}
</code></pre>

                        The above will give an error because you are trying to print the variable with name var which is on the other method.

                        <h6>Example to understand the all types of variables in java</h6>
                        <pre><code class=""language-java"">
class A{  
int data=50;//instance variable  
static int m=100;//static variable  
void method(){  
int n=90;//local variable  
}  
}//end of class

                        <p>
                            Version Control Systems(VCS) are the software tools for tracking/managing all the changes made to the source code during the project development. 
                            It stores your project(s) and allows you to view all the changes that you have made. What does this mean?, Think when you are developing 
                            your projects, their are many changes that you are making, where you are fixing bugs,deleting and updating codes. Sometimes 
                            you delete some codes and wish if you can get them back and that is where VCS comes in. A Version Control System allows 
                            you to view those codes that you have deleted by letting you see all changes that you have made from the starting point.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Types of Version Control System</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Local Version Control System</li>
                            <li>Centralized Version Control System</li>
                            <li>Distributed Version Control System</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Local Version Control System</h5>
                        <p>Local Version Control is the one which is located on your computer. To use a Local Version Control you need to download and install it on your pc.
                            The advantage of Local version control is that you don't always need internet in order for you to view the changes that you have made.
                            The great disadvantage is that if your machine crashes all your project on Local Version Control will be erased

                        <h5>Centralized Version Control System</h5>
                        <p>Centralized Version Control System is when the projects are put in one server that is accessible to your team. Think about it 
                            when your are developing one project with your friends, the good thing is to put the project in a place where your friends can 
                            edit it with their own machines.In the Centralized Version Control Systems, there will be a single central server that contains all the files related to the project</p>

                        <p>You can see that the only drawback of using centralized Version Cotrol is that, if it crashes everything will lost. Sorry if 
                            you have been wondering where the word <b> Repository</b> comes in,well this is just a place to store your project e.i I mean your project(s) in Version Control System</p>
                        <h5>Distributed Version Control System</h5>
                        <p>To overcome the problems of the above two, we have Distributed Version Control System which combines 
                            those above and make sure that there is also a VCS on your pc and the other(S) accessible to everyone. 
                            In a distributed version control system,  there will be one or more servers and many collaborators similar to the centralized system.
                            In this case if you have a project that you are doing with others, all the collaborators of that project will have their repository with 
                            the exact copy of project that you have.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Difference between Git and GitHub</h4>
                        <p>
                            We have introduced each other to Version Conrol Systems, they is no doubt that these two are examples of 
                            Version Control Systems. Yes, Git and Github they are Version Control Systems but they work differently and they are originated from 
                            different Companies.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Git is a Local Version Control System which tracks changes of the source codes on your PC. To use Git you need to<a href=""https://git-scm.com/downloads""> download and install it</a>
                            to your machine. 
                            It can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux.
                            On the other hand Github is a Centralized Version Control System. It is used to host your source codes through web cloud services. The 
                            best thing about github is that even when your PC is at home you can go to your project repository and view/edit the codes.
                            For you to use Github you need to create an account at <a href=""https://github.com/"">https://github.com/</a>. 
                            Github works with Git whereby you <b>push/update</b> your source codes from your local repository to your github repository(remote repository).
                            However using Git doesn't depend on github.
                        </p>

                            In almost all programming languages there is what we call Strings. In some languages strings are 
                            considered as data types, but in C this is not true. In this section we will explore whatever you need to know about string.

                            Previously we have talked about characters,recall we said when you want to create characters you do like below.
                        <pre><code class=""language-c"">
char ch='A'; //This is how to declare a character and give it a value;
</code></pre>
                        Think when we want to store a large number of characters, what where we going to use, arrays? Yes arrays are good to store many characters. 
                        Arrays will be good but we have another option which is String. A String is a sequence of characters, just like an arrays of characters 
                        a string stores a sequence of characters.

                            <p>We have two ways that we can use to decalare and initialize a String. Recall a String is a sequence of characters therefore 
                                dealing with string will be as easy as dealing with characters and array of characters. Below are ways to create a string</p>
                            <h6>Method 1: String Literal</h6>
                            <pre><code class=""language-c"">
#include&ltstdio.h>
int main(){
    char my_string[]=""chatsfly""; //String is a sequence of characters. Here is how to create a String
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>In the above example <b>line 4</b> we have seen how to create a string,the word <b>my_string</b> is a variable name 
                                followed by two square brackets <b>[]</b> which means that this is a form of an array. Then the value of this String is 
                                <b>chatsfly</b>. <br>
                                <b class=""note"">Note</b>: When creating a character we use single quotes,whereas when dealing with String we use double quotes.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Method 2: As an array of characters</h6>
                            <pre><code class=""language-c"">
#include&ltstdio.h>
int main(){
    char my_string[]={'c','h','a','t','s','f','l','y','\0'}; //String is a sequence of characters. Here is how to create a String
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>In the above example <b>line 4</b> we have seen how to create a string,the word <b>my_string</b> is a variable name 
                                followed by two square brackets <b>[]</b> which means that this is a form of an array. Because a string is an array of characters 
                                we can simply create a String from an array. The value of a variable <b>my_string</b> will be similar to the one 
                                on <b>Method 1</b> which is <b>chatsfly</b>. Please <b class=""note"">note</b> in the above example there is a
                                character '\0' at the end of the array, this is required when creating a String so as to differentiate it 
                                with normal array of characters.
                            </p>

                                    We cannot reassing a String Literal to another value while in character array we can.

                        <h4>Ways to print or read values in a String</h4>
                        <p>To print a String you just use a placeholder <b>%s</b>, remember when we want to print an int 
                            we use <b>%d</b> and for char its <b>%c</b>. Below is an example to print a String.
                        <pre><code class=""language-c"">
#include&ltstdio.h>
int main(){
    char my_string1[]={'c','h','a','t','s','f','l','y','\0'}; 
    char my_string2[]=""chatsfly""; 
  
    printf(""My first string is %s"",my_string1); // %s is a placeholder for string
    
    printf(""\nMy second string is %s"",my_string2); 
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
                        <div class=""card card-header""> 
                            <b>Output:</b>
                            My first string is chatsfly
                            <br>My second string is chatsfly
                        </div>
                        You can see that printing a String is the same weather you used method1 or 2.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Printing a character in a String.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Lets say you have a String and you want to print a character certain position. Just like in 
                            arrays to print a character in a string you need to specify it's index. See  example below:
                        <pre><code class=""language-c"">
#include&ltstdio.h>
int main(){
    
    char my_string[]=""chatsfly"";
    char first_char=my_string[0];  //To store the first character of my_string on variable first_char

#include&ltstdio.h>
int main(){
   
    char my_string[]=""chatsfly"";

    while(my_string[i]!='\0'){ //loop untill we get to the last elements
        printf(""%c"",my_string[i]);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;

                        <p><b class=""note"">Note:</b> The last element of a String in C is '\0'. We have seen this when creating a string in method2,
                            therefore by using a while loop until the last element '\0' we have managed to print all elements of a String</p>
